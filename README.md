Surf's up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview of the Surfs Up Analysis
- The purpose of the Surfs Up Analysis was to operate and use advanced data storage and retrieval techniques to perform an analysis on a weather data set, provided by our client Wav. This project required the usage of a query tool such as SQLAlchemy to be able to examine the weather data, a SQLite database, to perform and combine statistical analysis with dataframe analysis. Using SQLite with its local database features, which provides fast data queried by SQLAlchemy, allowed for the necessary information to provide to our client Wav. This weather analysis would help determine if opening a Surf n'Shake shop in Oahu would be a viable venture.
